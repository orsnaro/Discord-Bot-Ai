***SECOND***: ‚úîÔ∏ètype `/help` in any Chat channel to learn my commands then use them!

<sub> ***NOTE:*** _for now_ you wouldn't be able to make your own  sepcial channel [`üßôAsk-the-wizard channel`](https://discord.gg/ptAVHmrtJX) for now only try it in our [**server**](https://discord.com/invite/Y23B7R3FPq) </sub>

<sub> ***NOTE:*** the bot does not have any `adminstration` / `managing` / `moving` /  etc.. permissions. though I  recommend always to take a look at allowed permissions in <br> [`beta-bot invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=69241357196993&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscordapp.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3F%26client_id%3D1117540489365827594%26scope%3Dbot&response_type=code&scope=identify%20guilds%20gdm.join%20rpc.voice.read%20rpc.video.write%20rpc.activities.write%20messages.read%20applications.commands%20activities.read%20voice%20applications.commands.permissions.update%20dm_channels.read%20activities.write%20applications.store.update%20applications.builds.upload%20bot%20rpc.screenshare.read%20rpc.voice.write%20rpc%20guilds.join%20email%20role_connections.write%20relationships.read%20applications.entitlements%20applications.builds.read%20webhook.incoming%20rpc.screenshare.write%20rpc.video.read%20rpc.notifications.read%20guilds.members.read%20connections). feel free to sneak peak at our soucre code for any future changing of these intents/permissionsüíô </sub>

> ##  üõ† TODO :
#### ~‚ö†Ô∏è Do This BEFORE any New Features  &rarr;  *MIGRATE TO PYCORD.py!*~ -> [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)  is maintained Again!

*   Documentation for functions / classes repo. first readme.md draft
  
*   tutorial video on all bot features and how to use and invite it to you server ( 2 videos short & long  )


  
*   implement new Gemini feature _i.e.( upload image and ask about it )_ in your bot since it's now available and [Gemini API wrapper v0.1.27](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Gemini-API/releases/tag/0.1.27) now also  supports it
  
    
*   send Embeds fragmented in parts/pages if it exceeds max size ¬†(6000char) or exceeds max fields (25 field)  <sub>note: use pagination </sub>

*   show embedded images in Gemini answer (seperate images in links -> append them to an image section 'embed or normal message' -> show the images!)

*   wizard bot sqlite-DB  design and connect the DB with bot code
  
*   Implement `Competitive Programming` Features on Bot and [Narol's Island](https://discord.com/invite/Y23B7R3FPq) server  <sub>( more in  M O D S channels in the server)</sub>

*   OOP it!  and handle errors!

*   save last conversation ID (load it in init_bot.py) in text file and add command to start new conv. and set¬†default  to continue old one.

*   ~complete [`Gemini_key_refresh.py`](./Gemini_key_refresh.py)~

*   add `TTS` feature : read text in audio + ability for bot to join voice chats

*   ADD `STT`  feature to enable full voice chat feature between bot and island server's users ( make bot make real voice chat with members)

* use [`Rapidapi`](https://rapidapi.com)

* complete your [`quote`](https://github.com/orsnaro/quote-async) lib fork and make it fully async.

*   add and test poe-API (starred at my GitHub)
     - _NOTE:_ DeepSeek API is the one used now due to connection and belling issues beteen GPT-API i.e.(openAI API) and my country (Egypt)

*   add command to switch between Gemini mode and poe-GPT mode
  
       *  _(NOT necessary  NEED any more! now Gemini speaks arabic and Gemini API python wrapper also supports that  just edit your internal prompt / appendings and formating to discord messages to have arabic variation)_
    
*   Edit your Gemini args. and prompt to send full arabic query to Gemini (Gemini now has arabic lang suuport)
