> ##  üßô How to Use Me?!

&ensp;***FIRST***: &ensp;&nbsp;‚úîÔ∏èInvite me to a server  [`invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

***SECOND***: ‚úîÔ∏ètype `/help` in any Chat channel to learn my commands then use them!
   
***FINALLY***: &nbsp;‚úîÔ∏èreport me any issues!
   
<sub> ***NOTE:*** _for now_ you wouldn't be able to make your own  sepcial channel [`üßôAsk-the-wizard channel`](https://discord.gg/ptAVHmrtJX) for now only try it in our [**server**](https://discord.com/invite/Y23B7R3FPq) </sub>

<sub> ***NOTE:*** the bot does not have any `adminstration` / `managing` / `moving` /  etc.. permissions. though I  recommend always to take a look at allowed permissions in <br> [`beta-bot invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). feel free to sneak peak at our soucre code for any future changing of these intents/permissionsüíô </sub>

* [ ]  implement new bard feature _i.e.( upload image and ask about it )_ in your bot since it's now available and [Bard API wrapper v0.1.27](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/releases/tag/0.1.27) now also  supports it
  
    
* [ ]  send Embeds fragmented in parts/pages if it exceeds max size ¬†(6000char) or exceeds max fields (25 field)  <sub>note: use pagination </sub>
