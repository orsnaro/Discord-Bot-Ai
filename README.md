***SECOND***: ‚úîÔ∏ètype `help` in any Chat channel to learn my commands then use them!

<sub> ***NOTE:*** the bot does not have any `adminstration` / `managing` / `moving` /  etc.. permissions. though I  recommend always to take a look at allowed permissions in <br> [`beta-bot invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=69241357196993&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscordapp.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3F%26client_id%3D1117540489365827594%26scope%3Dbot&response_type=code&scope=identify%20guilds%20gdm.join%20rpc.voice.read%20rpc.video.write%20rpc.activities.write%20messages.read%20applications.commands%20activities.read%20voice%20applications.commands.permissions.update%20dm_channels.read%20activities.write%20applications.store.update%20applications.builds.upload%20bot%20rpc.screenshare.read%20rpc.voice.write%20rpc%20guilds.join%20email%20role_connections.write%20relationships.read%20applications.entitlements%20applications.builds.read%20webhook.incoming%20rpc.screenshare.write%20rpc.video.read%20rpc.notifications.read%20guilds.members.read%20connections). feel free to sneak peak at our soucre code for any future changing of these intents/permissionsüíô </sub>

*   send Embeds fragmented in parts/pages if it exceeds max size ¬†(6000char) or exceeds max fields (25 field)  <sub>note: use pagination </sub>
