> ##  üßô How to Use Me?!

&ensp;***FIRST***: &ensp;&nbsp;‚úîÔ∏èInvite me to a server  [`invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

If you want to add  wizy(feed,voice,chat) channels to your server contact me! later on this will be available to all via a command isha</sub>

<sub> ***NOTE:*** the bot does not have any `adminstration` / `managing` / `moving` /  etc.. permissions. though I  recommend always to take a look at allowed permissions in <br> [`beta-bot invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). feel free to sneak peak at our soucre code for any future changing of these intents/permissionsüíô </sub>
