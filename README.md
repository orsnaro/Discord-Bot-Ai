&ensp;***FIRST***: &ensp;&nbsp;‚úîÔ∏èInvite me to a server  [`invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=69241357196993&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscordapp.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3F%26client_id%3D1117540489365827594%26scope%3Dbot&response_type=code&scope=identify%20guilds%20gdm.join%20rpc.voice.read%20rpc.video.write%20rpc.activities.write%20messages.read%20applications.commands%20activities.read%20voice%20applications.commands.permissions.update%20dm_channels.read%20activities.write%20applications.store.update%20applications.builds.upload%20bot%20rpc.screenshare.read%20rpc.voice.write%20rpc%20guilds.join%20email%20role_connections.write%20relationships.read%20applications.entitlements%20applications.builds.read%20webhook.incoming%20rpc.screenshare.write%20rpc.video.read%20rpc.notifications.read%20guilds.members.read%20connections)

***SECOND***: ‚úîÔ∏ètype `help` in any Chat channel to learn my commands then use them!
   
***FINALLY***: &nbsp;‚úîÔ∏èreport me any issues!
   
<sub> ***NOTE:*** _for now_ you wouldn't be able to make your own  sepcial channel [`üßôAsk-the-wizard channel`](https://discord.gg/ptAVHmrtJX) for now only try it in our [**server**](https://discord.com/invite/Y23B7R3FPq) </sub>

<sub> ***NOTE:*** the bot does not have any `adminstration` / `managing` / `moving` /  etc.. permissions. though I  recommend always to take a look at allowed permissions in <br> [`beta-bot invite link`](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117540489365827594&permissions=69241357196993&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscordapp.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3F%26client_id%3D1117540489365827594%26scope%3Dbot&response_type=code&scope=identify%20guilds%20gdm.join%20rpc.voice.read%20rpc.video.write%20rpc.activities.write%20messages.read%20applications.commands%20activities.read%20voice%20applications.commands.permissions.update%20dm_channels.read%20activities.write%20applications.store.update%20applications.builds.upload%20bot%20rpc.screenshare.read%20rpc.voice.write%20rpc%20guilds.join%20email%20role_connections.write%20relationships.read%20applications.entitlements%20applications.builds.read%20webhook.incoming%20rpc.screenshare.write%20rpc.video.read%20rpc.notifications.read%20guilds.members.read%20connections). feel free to sneak peak at our soucre code for any future changing of these intents/permissionsüíô </sub>

*   Documentation for functions / classes repo. first readme.md draft
  
*   implement new bard feature _i.e.( upload image and ask about it )_ in your bot since it's now available and [Bard API wrapper v0.1.27](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/releases/tag/0.1.27) now also  supports it
  
    
*   send Embeds fragmented in parts/pages if it exceeds max size ¬†(6000char) or exceeds max fields (25 field)

*   ~use google translator API~
  
       *  _(NOT necessary  NEED any more! now bard speaks arabic and bard API python wrapper also supports that  just edit your internal prompt / appendings and formating to discord messages to have arabic variation)_
